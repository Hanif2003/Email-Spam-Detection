# Email-Spam-Detection

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to effectively detect spam emails. The primary goal is to classify emails as either "spam" or "not spam" using various features extracted from the email content. This project involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the email data for analysis.
Feature Extraction: Extracting relevant features from the email text such as word frequencies, special characters, etc.
Model Training: Implementing and training various machine learning algorithms to classify emails.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
